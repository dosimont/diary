* VPA Workshop, SC'14

Today, I'm attending to the [[http://cedmav.org/vpa2014.html][1st VPA Workshop]], at [[http://conferences.computer.org/vpa/2014/][SC'14]]

** Session 1

*** [[http://conferences.computer.org/vpa/2014/papers/7058a001.pdf][Visualization of Performance Data for MPI Applications Using Circular Hierarchies]]

Unfortunately, I missed the first presentation.
It seems to be an interesting way to represent communications between nodes using a circular hierarchy. Looks a bit like ExtraVis.

This gives me an idea: represent our aggregation using a circular representation, where time is given by the distance to the central point, and the hierarchy represented as a "circular tree".

- TorusVis
- Node representation and selection
- There is a time slice selection, same kind of principle than Triva
- Shneiderman approach filled -> data exploration, from top to more details
- Interaction: selection, filtering, brushing
- Future work: 
  - Scalability
  - Multiresolution capabilities
  - Multiperspective?

Circular representations seem to be the new buzz ;-)


*** [[http://conferences.computer.org/vpa/2014/papers/7058a017.pdf][Down to Earth - How to Visualize Traffic on High-dimensional Torus Networks]]

"Plane" approach. I didn't follow well.

*** [[http://conferences.computer.org/vpa/2014/papers/7058a024.pdf][Visualizing the Five-dimensional Torus Network of the IBM Blue Gene/Q]]

- Main purpose: visualize 5D
- Again focused on communications patterns.
- Again, BlueGene is used as a use case.
- Again, they focus on torus networks.

We should mind about a way to represent these kinds of topology, since it seems to be a current issue.

- The guy show a 2D Projection of a 3D Torus, using a perspective technique.

- Then it is transformed into another views. This new representation is composed by imbricated rectangles. There is also a color gradient that this correspond to the spatial location of torus components.


** Session 2

*** [[http://conferences.computer.org/vpa/2014/papers/7058a028.pdf][CommGram: A New Visual Analytics Tool for Large Communication Trace Data]]

- A clustering technique representing communications over time. They use bipartite graph representations and B-spline curves to improve the readability.
