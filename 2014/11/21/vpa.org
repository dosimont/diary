* VPA Workshop, SC'14

Today, I'm attending to the [[http://cedmav.org/vpa2014.html][1st VPA Workshop]], at [[http://conferences.computer.org/vpa/2014/][SC'14]]

** Session 1

*** [[http://conferences.computer.org/vpa/2014/papers/7058a001.pdf][Visualization of Performance Data for MPI Applications Using Circular Hierarchies]]

Unfortunately, I missed the first presentation.
It seems to be an interesting way to represent communications between nodes using a circular hierarchy. Looks a bit like ExtraVis.

This gives me an idea: represent our aggregation using a circular representation, where time is given by the distance to the central point, and the hierarchy represented as a "circular tree".

- TorusVis
- Node representation and selection
- There is a time slice selection, same kind of principle than Triva
- Shneiderman approach filled -> data exploration, from top to more details
- Interaction: selection, filtering, brushing
- Future work: 
  - Scalability
  - Multiresolution capabilities
  - Multiperspective?

Circular representations seems to be the new buzz :;-)

"Plane" approach. I didn't follow well.
