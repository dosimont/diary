* VPA Workshop, SC'14

Today, I'm attending to the [1st VPA Workshop][http://cedmav.org/vpa2014.html]], at [SC'14][http://conferences.computer.org/vpa/2014/]]

*** Visualization of Performance Data for MPI Applications Using Circular Hierarchies

Unfortunately, I missed the first presentation

*** TorusVis?ND: Unraveling High-Dimensional Torus Networks for Network Traffic Visualizations

- TorusVis
- Node representation and selection
- There is a time slice selection, same kind of principle than Triva
- Shneiderman approach filled -> data exploration, from top to more details
- Interaction: selection, filtering, brushing
- Future work: 
  - Scalability
  - Multiresolution capabilities
  - Multiperspective?
